# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to the `OME-Zarr` specification!
We welcome contributions from anyone.

The below sections explain how to contributed in different ways to the
`OME-Zarr` specification.

## Major changes to the specification

Any suggested major changes to the `OME-Zarr` specification should be opened as
request for comment (RFC) documents.

In the future we will flesh out this page with a guide to RFCs, but in the
meantime the RFC process is outlined in the
[Implementation section of RFC 1](../rfc/1/index.md#implementation).

## Comment on a request for comment (RFC)

If you want to leave a suggestion or comment on an RFC that is under review,
please leave a comment in a new page under the "comments/" directory for the
relevant RFC. A template is also available for formatting your comment:
[template](../rfc/1/templates/review_template).

## Minor changes to website pages

Any minor fixes/improvements to these pages should be opened as an issue in the
[`ome/ngff repository`](https://github.com/ome/ngff), and be fixed/implemented
with a pull request in the [`ome/ngff` repository](https://github.com/ome/ngff).
