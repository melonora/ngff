# RFC-1: Review 1 Round 2

## Review authors
This review was written by:
- Joel Lüthi
- Virginie Uhlmann
- Kevin Yamauchi

## Summary

We commend the Author for their thorough revision and detailed response to our
comments. The revision has significantly improved the quality of the RFC
overall. We thus recommend the acceptance of this RFC. We are particularly
grateful for the following changes, which greatly enhance the readability and
clarity of the document:

- The high level diagram is extremely useful and contributes to making the
  document more approachable and easier to understand;
- The roles and responsibilities of each party and of the Editor have been
  appropriately clarified; 
- The purpose statements provided for every phase are incredibly useful and
  clearly convey the rationale behind each step of the process.

As mentioned in our initial review, we feel that the process introduced in this
RFC is essential to allow the community to move forward and iterate upon the
NGFF. Given the importance of such a process, we believe that the proposed
process is viable and that pragmatism should be favored over perfection. As
accurately pointed out in the response, clarity on the NGFF specification
process is critically needed for the continuation and success of NGFF, and the
proposed solution fulfills this need.

We have read the feedback from Review 2 and we acknowledge that the proposed
process is likely not perfect. We however feel that many of the requests for
clarification have been fully satisfied and that the proposal provides the
opportunity for community contributors who may not be satisfied with the
current process to propose alternatives or amendments by submitting their own
RFC.

## Minor comments and questions

1. Definition of Endorsers: While the new definition of endorsers is
   commendable, we still have concerns regarding whether a potential reviewer
   can endorse an early RFC draft. In the “Reviewer Accept” section, the phrase
   “This is equivalent to the Reviewer joining the list of endorsements” might
   be interpreted as “If I endorse a draft proposal, my review verdict would be
   accept,” suggesting that a review acceptance is equivalent to an
   endorsement. To clarify, we recommend rewording this as: “[...] additional
   context may be provided for the written record. A Reviewer who accepts an
   RFC is joining the list of endorsements.”
2. Conflict of Interest Inclusion: We agree that the goal is not to silence
   voices with potential conflicts of interest but to ensure transparency. We
   support the addition of a “Conflicts of Interest” section in the review
   process. We suggest that RFC1 include “Conflicts of Interest” as a “useful
   section to include” in the review and that it be mentioned in the “Choice of
   Reviewers” section. A possible wording could be: “Editors and Reviewers
   should proactively disclose any potential conflicts of interest to ensure a
   transparent review process.”
3. Minor Typographical Note: In the “Implementation” section, it mentions
   “various stakeholders (in bold)”; however, in Figure 2, the stakeholders are
   no longer highlighted in bold. We recommend updating the figure or adjusting
   the text to reflect the current formatting.

## Recommendation

We recommend that RFC1 be accepted.
